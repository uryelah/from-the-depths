## [Game Design](id:gamedesign)
### Summary
You are a milenar giant squid whose sleep is disturbed by human mounting an offshore oil rig and harming your domain and protected animals. 
You decide to take on the humans, trying to destroy the oild righ while warding off their attacks with your fellow deep water creatures.
### Gameplay
This is a shooter style game. You and your forces attack from the bottom of the screen and the humans and their machines attack from the top in waves.
### Mindset
This game is supposed to evoke space shooters combined with tower deffence games, though reversed to tower destructing, and with more interesting attack patterns given to your helpers and power ups.

## [Technical](id:technical)

Just one vertical screen. Maybe following to the top or bottom with the tentacles
### Controls

Mouse move to follow tentacles.
Click for attack. (Click and hold for stronger attack)
